## 🔹 About Me

I’m a **Senior DevOps & Platform Engineer** with 3+ years of experience in building cloud-native, highly available infrastructure—primarily Kubernetes and OpenShift—integrated with **Cisco ACI**, **enterprise storage systems**, and full GitOps-based automation. Before that, I spent 5+ years as a **Network, Security, and Datacenter Engineer**, designing fault-tolerant systems and managing large-scale networks. I specialize in **network automation**, high availability, and secure, multi-cluster platforms.
